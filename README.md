Nyota is an intelligent English-speaking officer for your computer. She
understands English and will carry out your every command. Well, only those
commands you teach to her.

Nyota is different from other language processors, such as Siri and Google Now,
in that she is built to execute actionable commands. She is not a question bot,
or a conversation AI (although those might make nifty plugins), but rather an
officer who awaits commands from the captain of your computer, you, and carries
them out. This project is inspired by the aspiration of human-like interaction
with computers.


## A Plugin-Based NLP
Nyota is a Natural Language Processor capable of parsing sentences with the
knowledge given to her (the knowledge of specific grammatical feature
structures, or words with context). Once a sentence has been parsed, an action
can be composed using the phrase's components.

Users can configure Nyota by specifying words, their appropriate grammatical
contexts, and their meaning (a verb might represent a function that takes a
subject and a direct object, and performs some action with them).


## Installation
Clone Nyota from github:
```
git clone https://github.com/patgrasso/Nyota
```


## Try It
```javascript
const CFG = require('./grammar/cfg');
//const rd  = require('./parsing/shift-reduce');

let cfg = new CFG();

cfg.production('S', { name: 'NP', num: '?n' }, { name: 'VP', num: '?n' });
cfg.production('NP', 'Det', 'NP');
cfg.production('NP', 'Adj', 'NP');
cfg.production({ name: 'NP', num: '?n' }, { name: 'N', num: '?n' });
cfg.production({ name: 'VP', num: '?n' }, { name: 'V' , num: '?n' }, 'AP');
cfg.production('AP', 'Adv', 'Adj');
cfg.production('AP', 'Adj');

cfg.production({ name: 'N', num: 'sg' }, 'Nyota');
cfg.production({ name: 'V', num: 'sg' }, 'is');
cfg.production('Adv', 'very');
cfg.production('Adj', 'intelligent');

cfg.production({ name: 'N', num: 'pl' }, 'bananas');
cfg.production({ name: 'V', num: 'pl' }, 'are');
cfg.production('Adj', 'yellow');

//rd.parse('Nyota is very intelligent');
//rd.parse('bananas are yellow');
```


## Testing
Testing Nyota requres jasmine (2.0+). All specs can be found in `spec/`. To run
all tests, simply run `npm test` in the project's root.

## Concepts
To gain a better understanding of NLP and the magic that makes Nyota work, take
a look at [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org) and perhaps give *Natural Language
Processing with Python* a read. They are great resources for understanding the
natural language concepts that Nyota implements.
