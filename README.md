# Nyota :stars:
Nyota is an intelligent communication officer for your computer. She understands
English and will carry out your every command. Well, only those commands you teach
to her.


## A Plugin-Based NLP
Nyota is a Natural Language Processor capable of parsing sentences with the
knowledge given to her (the knowledge of specific grammatical feature structures,
or words with context). Once a sentence has been parsed, an action can be composed
using the phrase's components.

Users can configure Nyota by specifying words, their appropriate grammatical
contexts, and their meaning (a verb might represent a function that takes a subject
and a direct object, and performs some action with them).


## Concepts
To gain a better understanding of NLP and the magic that makes Nyota work, take a
look at [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org) and perhaps give Natural Language Processing
with Python a read. It is a great resource for understanding the concepts behind
understanding natural language that Nyota implements.
