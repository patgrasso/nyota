# Contributing to Nyota
Pull requests are highly encouraged! I warmly welcome ideas that further the
development of the project. There are a number of ways to become involved:

- Use Nyota and report any found bugs
- Participate in issue discussions
- Request new features
- Reviewing code

...to name a few.


## Pull Requests
Before submitting a pull request, please ensure that there are no conflicts
with master. Before coding up the best new feature ever, please make sure that
the improvement or feature is within the scope of the project and that it has
been discussed in an issue, otherwise it may not be merged.


## Style
Just a few friendly suggestions to keep the code clean and happy:

- I am a stickler for clean code. ESLint is a great linter, but so long as you
are using some JavaScript linter, I will be happy.
- Two spaces, not tabs (if your workflow or global config differs, look into
[smudgers and cleaners](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes#Keyword-Expansion)).
- Always test either before or alongside development. A clever person once said,
"untested code is legacy code and will likely be re-written".
